* To increase memcache size (example below will set cache size to 2G)

    ```
    # cat /etc/memcached.conf
    ...deleted...
    # Start with a cap of 64 megs of memory. It's reasonable, and the daemon default
    # Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
    # memory
    -m 2000
    
    ...deleted...
    ```
  
* check memcache statistics

    ```

* important stats

    * limit_maxbytes = max cache size
    * bytes = current utilization
        * if bytes close to limit_maxbytes, increase the memory/cache size
    * evictions = number of data that removed from the cache before it is expired, usually because the is no more space for new data
        * if evictions stat increases, it is time to increate the cache size. Ideally evictions should be 0
    * delete_miss
        * number of data that could not be found during delete operation, probably because of evictions.
    ...TBD..
