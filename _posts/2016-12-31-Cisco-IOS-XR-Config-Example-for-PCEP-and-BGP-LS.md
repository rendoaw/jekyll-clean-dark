## Notes
* if lsp-delegation is enabled globally under mpls traffic-eng -> pce section, looks like all configured LSP will become delegated LSP
* LSP delegation can be enabled per LSP


## PCEP 

### Configuration

* To configure tunnel source address. Without this, PCE initiated/delegated  LSP will not up

    ```
    ipv4 unnumbered mpls traffic-eng Loopback0
    ```

* PCEP configuration

    ```
    mpls traffic-eng
      pce
        peer source ipv4 13.0.0.2
        peer ipv4 1.1.1.178
          precedence 20
        ! 
        stateful-client
          instantiation
          delegation    --> optional. If set, all LSP become delegated
          report
        !
      !
      auto-tunnel pcc
      tunnel-id min 1000 max 5000
      !
    !
    ```

* check PCE server status

    ```

    ```


### PCC Controller LSP/Normal LSP

* By default, IOS-XR doesn't send RRO to PCE server unless "record-route" is explicitly configured

    ```
    interface tunnel-te0
     ipv4 unnumbered Loopback0
     destination 13.0.0.4
     record-route
     path-option 10 dynamic
    !
    ```


### Delegated LSP

* The following LSP is delegated to PCE server. Make sure both path option and pce delegation are set properly.

```
interface tunnel-te1
 ipv4 unnumbered Loopback0
 destination 13.0.0.4
 record-route
 path-option 10 dynamic pce
 pce
  delegation
!
```

* The following LSP will prefer path received from external controller and if external controller is not available, it will fallback to router own calculated dynamic path 

```
interface tunnel-te3
 ipv4 unnumbered Loopback0
 destination 13.0.0.4
 record-route
 path-option 10 dynamic pce
 path-option 20 dynamic
 pce
  delegation
 !
!
```

* this is what looks like when external controller is available

### PCE Initiated LSP

* The following LSP is created from external controller. Notice that IOS-XR normalizes the tunnel name and keep the actual tunnel name as Signalled Name.
